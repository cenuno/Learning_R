Julian High School is one of nine high schools serving the Far South Side.  Julian is a neighborhood school, however many students who do not live in attendance area enroll in the school to participate in the four Career Technical Education programs.  Our commitment to graduate students who are prepared for postsecondary success is demonstrated by our low drop-out rate which was less than 3% in 2014-15, among the lowest in Chicago Public Schools, as well as the college enrollment and persistence rates.  Julian is rated strong in the arts.  Recognitions have been received for the outstanding work of the Radio-TV Broadcasting Academy and Marching Band. The grade-level interdisciplinary service-learning program has received national recognition from the Education Commission of the States.  The AVID (Advancement VIA Individual Determination) program has received national certification.  Students have opportunities to participate in a variety of extra-curricular activities.  The support and engagement of community partners, including alumni, working with the school is strong.  ",Principal,Myron L Hester,Assistant Principal,Ms. Michelle Brumfield,10330 S ELIZABETH ST,Chicago,Illinois,60643,7735355170,7735355230,http://cps.edu/Schools/Pages/school.aspx?SchoolID=609762,http://www.pljulianhs.net,NA,NA,NA,NA,Y,"9,10,11,12",9-12,509,490,119,1,503,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,There are 509 students enrolled at JULIAN HS.  96.3% are Low Income Students.  23.4% are Diverse Learners.  0.2% are Limited English Learners.,The largest demographic at JULIAN HS is Black.
